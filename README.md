## Welcome to javascript-challenge

This activity is to provide code that will create a table dynamically based upon a dataset supplied for the homework.

The homework has 2 Levels.  Level 1 is required and Level 2 is Optional.  Both Levels were completed.

### I. Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search (Required) - completed

The index.html file provided was used as the basis for the effort to render the overall UFO and subsequently filtered datasets.

JavaScript was used to present the entire table upon inital rendering and then filter the table based on a date supplied by the user.

The rendered table has a column for date, city, state, country, shape, and comment.

Instructions were added to the basis index.html for how tp make a date request and Clear & Refresh button was added to reset the table.

The Javascript, app.js, high-level pseudocode was:
 - render data displaying the full table
 - identify connection (button) between html and JavaScript that would bring desired filter in app.js
 - Using filter, create new array with only desired date for review
 - Render/display desired date and associated data

### II.Level 2: Multiple Search Categories (Optional) - completed

Complete all of Level 1 criteria.

Objective was to use code from Level 1 and add addtional input tags so user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings in a more detailed manner.  The additional filters added were:
 - city
 - state
 - country
 - shape

The Javascript, app.js, high-level pseudocode was:
 - render data displaying the full table
 - identify connection (button) between html and JavaScript that would bring desired filter in app.js
 - amend code to use additional filters
 - Using filters in if statements and when criteria met, create new array with only desired data for review
 - Render/display desired data
